## RockPaperScissors

This project is a basic version of Rock Paper Scissors written in JavaScript, played using the console and prompt boxes.
It was a project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), to demonstrate my knowledge of basics such as functions, strings, and variables.
